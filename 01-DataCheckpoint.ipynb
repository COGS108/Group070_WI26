    "Sleep plays an important role in overall health because it helps the brain and body function properly each day. Getting enough sleep supports memory, concentration, metabolism, and general productivity. On the other hand, not getting enough sleep can lead to problems such as weakened immunity, mood changes, and mental health concerns. Since sleep affects so many parts of daily life, researchers often study what habits might improve or worsen sleep.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sleep quality can mean different things, but in this project it is defined specifically as sleep duration, or how many hours a person sleeps. Previous research shows that consistently short sleep duration is linked to higher risks of weight gain, heart disease, stroke, anxiety, and depression.<sup>1</sup> Because of these risks, it is useful to understand which behaviors are connected to sleeping longer or shorter amounts of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several lifestyle factors may influence sleep duration, including diet, screen use, and physical activity.<sup>2</sup> Physical activity is especially important because it affects both energy levels and the body’s natural sleep cycle. Studies suggest that people who exercise regularly, especially through daily movement or cardiovascular activity, tend to sleep longer and more consistently than those who are inactive.<sup>2</sup> This suggests that an active routine may support healthier sleep patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a study of undergraduate students in China found that students who exercised less and spent more time on screens before bed reported worse sleep outcomes.<sup>3</sup> This supports the idea that daily activity levels may be connected to how long people sleep. Building on this idea, this project will examine how the total duration of daily physical activity relates to sleep duration in adults aged 16 and older. Other factors such as age, gender, occupation, BMI, and blood pressure will also be considered to better understand the relationship between activity and sleep.\n"

    "**Hypothesis**\n",
    "\n",
    "We hypothesize that average sleep duration on weekdays (in minutes per night) will be shorter for those with higher BMI, advancing age, and higher blood pressure than for those with more favorable values of these variables. Specifically, we hypothesize that those who are classified as overweight or obese will have shorter average sleep duration on weekdays than those who have a normal BMI.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also hypothesize that physical activity will be positively related to sleep duration. Those who accumulate fewer total minutes of physical activity per week will have shorter average sleep duration than those who accumulate the recommended 150 minutes per week. Furthermore, we hypothesize that sleep duration will vary by gender and occupation category, especially for those in more sedentary or stressful occupations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale**\n",
    "\n",
    "Sleep duration (in minutes per night) is affected by both physical health and daily lifestyle factors. A higher BMI is commonly associated with health issues like sleep apnea and breathing disturbances that can lead to lower overall sleep duration. As people grow older, their sleep patterns can become more fragmented, leading to lower overall sleep duration per night. High blood pressure can be an indicator of stress or other health issues that can disrupt sleep.\n",
    "\n",
    "Physical activity can help promote healthier sleep patterns by controlling energy levels and the body’s natural sleep cycle. People who are more active on a weekly basis may have longer sleep duration than people who are less active. By analyzing sleep in minutes per night and activity in minutes per week, we can see if these factors are significantly related to sleep duration."

The 6,161 records represent all respondents in this cycle who provided sleep questionnaire data prior to merging or cleaning procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Number of Variables:**  \n",
    "11 variables  \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains the following variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SEQN** – Respondent sequence number (unique participant ID)\n",
    "- **SLQ300** – Usual sleep time on weekdays/workdays\n",
    "- **SLQ310** – Usual wake time on weekdays/workdays\n",
    "- **SLQ320** – Usual sleep time on weekends/non-workdays\n",
    "- **SLQ330** – Usual wake time on weekends/non-workdays\n",
    "- **SLD012** – Usual sleep duration on weekdays (hours)\n",
    "- **SLD013** – Usual sleep duration on weekends (hours)\n",
    "- **SLQ040** – Ever told by a doctor that you have a sleep disorder\n",

    "- **SLQ070** – Snoring frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, we focus primarily on the sleep timing and sleep duration variables (SLQ300–SLQ330, SLD012, and SLD013).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description of Variables Most Relevant to This Project:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the dataset contains 11 variables, our analysis centers on sleep timing and duration patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary variables include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Weekday Bedtime (SLQ300)** – Usual time participant goes to sleep on weekdays/workdays (clock time).\n",
    "- **Weekday Wake Time (SLQ310)** – Usual time participant wakes up on weekdays/workdays.\n",
    "- **Weekend Bedtime (SLQ320)** – Usual time participant goes to sleep on weekends/non-workdays.\n",
    "- **Weekend Wake Time (SLQ330)** – Usual time participant wakes up on weekends/non-workdays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these timing variables, we derive:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Weekday sleep duration (hours)\n",
    "- Weekend sleep duration (hours)\n",
    "- Difference between weekday and weekend sleep timing (indicator of social jet lag / circadian misalignment)\n",
    "\n",
    "We also analyze:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SLD012** – Self-reported weekday sleep duration (hours per night)\n",
    "- **SLD013** – Self-reported weekend sleep duration (hours per night)\n",
    "\n",
    "Sleep duration is reported in **hours per night**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For adults:\n",
    "- 7–9 hours → Recommended healthy sleep range\n",
    "- Less than 7 hours → Associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, cognitive impairment, and mortality\n",
    "- Less than 5–6 hours → Considered very short sleep and may indicate elevated health risk\n",
    "- Greater than 9–10 hours → May also be associated with adverse health outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "Large differences between weekday and weekend sleep timing may reflect social jet lag, which has been linked to metabolic and mental health risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Shortcomings of the Dataset:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Self-Reported Sleep Measures**  \n",
    "All sleep measures are self-reported, which may introduce recall bias and rounding error (for example, reporting 10:00 PM instead of 9:47 PM). Self-reported sleep duration typically overestimates true sleep compared to objective measures such as actigraphy or wearable sleep trackers. The dataset does not measure sleep quality, awakenings, restfulness, or sleep stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Missing and Uncertain Responses**  \n",
    "Some responses include “Don’t Know,” “Refused,” or placeholder values. These were recoded as NaN during cleaning. Removing incomplete responses may slightly affect representativeness.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Time Conversion**  \n",
    "Sleep duration was originally reported in hours and converted to minutes for alignment with the physical activity dataset. Biologically implausible values (less than or equal to 0 or greater than 24 hours) were removed during cleaning to ensure accuracy and consistency.\n"

    "   The dataset reports total weekly minutes but does not specify how activity is distributed across days. For analysis purposes, daily activity may be estimated by dividing weekly minutes by 7; however, this assumes activity is evenly distributed.

    "The purpose of merging the NHANES Sleep Questionnaire (SLQ_J) and the Physical Activity Questionnaire (PAQ_J) datasets is to examine the relationship between sleep patterns and physical activity levels among U.S. adults. Our research question investigates whether differences in physical activity are associated with variations in weekday and weekend sleep duration.\n",

    "The sleep dataset provides measures of weekday and weekend sleep duration, allowing us to calculate total sleep minutes and differences between weekday and weekend sleep (an indicator of social jet lag). The physical activity dataset provides weekly minutes of moderate and vigorous activity, which can be combined to determine total physical activity levels and whether individuals meet public health guidelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "By merging the datasets on the unique participant identifier (SEQN), we ensure that sleep and activity data correspond to the same individuals. This allows us to directly analyze whether more physically active individuals tend to sleep longer, have more consistent sleep schedules, or exhibit different sleep patterns compared to less active individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Merging the datasets is essential because analyzing them separately would not allow us to assess individual-level associations between activity and sleep. "

    "This project uses publicly available data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2017–2018 cycle, conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The data are fully anonymized and do not contain any personally identifiable information.

All findings will be presented at the population level. We will avoid overgeneralizing results or suggesting that certain demographic characteristics such as age, gender, or body measurements directly determine sleep outcomes.\n",

    "We also recognize that sleep and health-related measures are influenced by many complex factors, including genetics, environment, lifestyle, and socioeconomic conditions. Any associations found in the data will be discussed carefully to avoid stigmatizing or stereotyping individuals or groups. The intention is to understand patterns, not to assign blame or make assumptions.\n",

    "Throughout the project, all data cleaning steps, transformations, and analytical decisions will be clearly documented to ensure transparency and integrity. Any limitations, such as self-reported measures or missing data, will be openly acknowledged. Overall, the analysis will be conducted thoughtfully and responsibly, with respect for the individuals represented in the dataset.\n"
