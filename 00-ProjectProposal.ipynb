    "Sleep is an important factor in the human body’s overall health, and it is essential for all individuals to get sufficient sleep to support cognitive function, metabolism regulation, and productivity in day-to-day tasks. However, it is important to note that a lack of sleep in many adults can lead to severe health issues, such as a decreased immune response as well as disruptions in mood regulation and mental health. Because of the major role that sleep plays in overall well-being, researchers have studied how certain lifestyle and environmental factors influence sleep quality.\n",

    "Researchers have found that sleep does not only pertain to how long one sleeps, but also the quality and duration of the sleep that occurs. For example, sleep must be uninterrupted and allow the body to repair and restore its functions overnight in order to prepare for the following day. With this in mind, prior research explains how good-quality sleep allows both the brain and body to recover, while poor sleep can carry similar risks to getting little to no sleep at all. According to the Sleep Foundation, insufficient or low-quality sleep is linked to weight gain, heart disease, stroke, and mental health problems such as anxiety and depression.<a name=\"cite_ref-SleepFoundation\"></a><sup>1</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, it is important to note that researchers have studied various lifestyle factors that are linked to the quality and duration of sleep individuals are able to obtain. For instance, factors such as diet, including excessive junk food consumption, screen time, social media use, and physical activity have all been associated with sleep quality.<a name=\"cite_ref-Dzierzewski2021\"></a><sup>2</sup> Researchers have also observed that regular physical activity throughout the day, such as a sufficient amount of cardiovascular exercise, can lead to better overall sleep patterns, especially as individuals age. These findings suggest that unhealthy habits can result in poorer sleep outcomes, while active lifestyles support better sleep quality.<a name=\"cite_ref-Dzierzewski2021\"></a><sup>2</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In a study conducted in China, it was found that a large population of undergraduate students experienced poor sleep quality due to low levels of physical exercise and high amounts of screen time before bedtime.<a name=\"cite_ref-Wu2022\"></a><sup>3</sup> Although this project will examine several additional factors such as gender, age, occupation, BMI, and blood pressure in addition to lifestyle behaviors like physical exercise, it is important to recognize that each of these factors may have a significant impact on sleep quality. These relationships will be explored further throughout this project.\n"

    "Hypothesis: Sleep quality will be worse among individuals with higher BMI or obesity, older age, and abnormal blood pressure. We also expect sleep quality to differ across occupations and gender, with people in more sedentary or high-stress jobs and men reporting poorer sleep overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rationale: Sleep is influenced by both physical health and daily lifestyle. Higher BMI and obesity are linked to sleep problems like breathing disruptions, while aging is often associated with more fragmented sleep. Blood pressure can reflect stress and underlying health conditions that interfere with rest. Occupation and gender may also shape sleep through differences in stress levels, routines, and biological factors, making them important variables to examine when studying sleep quality."

    "The ideal dataset would contain clear, primarily numerical measurements of a person’s sleep quality and the lifestyle habits that are typically associated with sleep. These variables would include physical activity level, daily steps, stress level, heart rate, occupation, and more. This dataset should also take note of demographic characteristics such as age and gender, which can influence sleep quality as well. We would ideally want over 200 observations that have a balanced distribution of different ages, genders, and types of habits. A dataset without any biased representation would ensure that the results of our project are reliable and applicable to the real-world. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the dataset should include numerical data regarding the subjects’ personal and health indicators. Certain measurements such as stress level and sleep quality are highly subjective due to being self-reported, so these features would be difficult to analyze without a numerical representation. For example, one subject’s good quality of sleep could be another subject’s bad quality of sleep. Such subjectivity also amplifies the natural bias in the dataset. Therefore, the data should clearly define a numerical scale that can be more objectively interpreted and easily analyzed. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kaggle Sleep, Health, and Lifestyle dataset is suitable for answering our research question because it contains several measurements of lifestyle habits, health, and demographics such as physical activity levels, stress levels, BMI categories, heart rate, blood pressure, age, and gender. This dataset also contains useful sleep metrics such as sleep quality, sleep disorders, and sleep duration. This dataset also contains 400 observations that are widely spread across ages 27-59 and have an even distribution of male and female subjects. All features are numerically represented, making them easy to analyze and draw conclusions from. In addition, the Kaggle Sleep Efficiency dataset can be used as a supporting dataset to analyze sleep quality at a deeper level using efficiency and sleep stage measurements, while the primary dataset focuses on broader lifestyle habits. This secondary dataset also provides bedtime and wakeup time habits, which can also be studied to support our analysis. Collectively, both of these datasets can help us answer our research question.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> The dataset is publicly available from Kaggle and already anonymized, meaning individuals cannot be identified or re-identified. Because we do not collect the data ourselves, our project does not directly interact with human subjects. The data will be used strictly for academic purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    " The dataset may not equally represent all populations or lifestyles, which could influence relationships between sleep quality and variables such as BMI, occupation, gender, or age. We will interpret results only as population-level associations and avoid broad generalizations.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    " - [ ] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [ ] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    " - [ ] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " - [ ] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",

    "\n",
    " Sleep quality is affected by many factors not captured in the dataset, such as genetics, environment, and socioeconomic conditions. We will acknowledge these limitations and avoid presenting conclusions as complete explanations.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "\n",
    " Demographic and body metrics may correlate due to social or environmental factors rather than biological causes. We will avoid interpretations that stereotype individuals based on gender, occupation, or body type.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "\n",
    " The goal is to identify statistical associations rather than causal or medical claims. Findings will not be presented as treatment recommendations or diagnoses.\n",

    " - [ ] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    "\n",
    " Any patterns discovered will be explained clearly and cautiously, emphasizing that personal attributes do not determine sleep disorders and that results reflect trends, not individual predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [ ] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "\n",
    " We will state that the analysis should not be used for medical advice, diagnosis, or decision-making about individuals, only for understanding general sleep patterns in populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further Ethics Considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    " The analysis uses publicly available datasets from Kaggle that are already anonymized and do not contain any personally identifiable information. Due to the fact that the subjects’ identities are unknown and cannot be reidentified, there are very minimal privacy risks. The data will be used strictly for academic purposes and handled responsibly throughout the analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to identify statistical associations related to sleep quality rather than to make causal or medical claims. In this case, the focus is on correlational relationships revolving around sleep quality, not to give recommendations on health or make findings on temporal relationships with gender and/or age. Care will also be taken to avoid interpretations that could stereotype or unfairly label individuals based on characteristics such as gender, occupation, or body type. Rather than displaying findings based on prejudgmental predictions that support stereotypes, they will be presented solely off population level trends that do not include any ethically-violated stereotypes of any sort. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the analysis will carefully handle health conditions and sleep disorders, being very cautious and sensitive discussing these topics. Personal attributes don’t shape sleep disorders; rather, it’s certain genetics and environments that play the bigger role. Therefore ethically, these conditions will be handled with care and taken into account when making our findings. The dataset also displays body metrics a ton, so the associations between sleep quality and body metrics will be made truthfully and morally considering the fact that these qualities are influenced by traits like socioeconomic status and genetics, nothing else. \n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the purpose and boundaries of scope of this study, it doesn’t aim to recommended treatments, but rather to present findings so the audience better comprehends sleep patterns within populations. All in all, each line of code, each change, and each analytical practice will be made truthfully and documented concisely to best present the data and allow groupmates to visualize the work done by each other accordingly. If an ethical bias, concern, or inequality occurs during the analysis process, they will be addressed immediately and clearly to best ensure integrity and human dignity. \n"
